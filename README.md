I have forked an uncooked version of the original repository to add some features and fix some bugs.  
The original repository is available at https://github.com/selvin-paul-raj/Quote-Generator-React-App

# Quote Generator React App

This is a simple React application that generates random quotes. It uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage state and side effects, respectively. The app fetches quotes from an external API and displays them on the screen.

## Features

- Fetches random quotes from an external API
- Displays the quote and author
- Allows users to generate a new quote

### New Features Added in This Fork
